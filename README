COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE (getting write access):
-----------------------------------------------

The copyright and license are contained in the top-level file
COPYRIGHT.  The copyright is held by LANL for the ATS.  However, it is
important to note that the copyright for Amanzi, the ASCEM simulator
that we derive from (and will contribute to), is held jointly between
the DOE labs participating in ASCEM.  If you are a developer that
would like write permission on the ATS repository you must send an
e-mail to David Moulton (moulton@lanl.gov), containing the following
statement:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I <insert name>, am currently employed by <insert lab>.  I have read
and accept the terms and conditions presented in the COPYRIGHT file of
the ATS repository.  In particular, I understand that

 1. as a developer contributing new code to the ATS repository I
    must have the right to do so, implicitly asserting copyright on
    behalf of their laboratory on that contribution;

 2. all new code that is contributed will be under the standard
    three-clause BSD license contained in the copyright file, and so
    by contributing code I assert that I have the right to chose this
    BSD license for my contribution;

 3. if an existing package is contributed by a developer, the
    original copyright must be maintained, and the license must
    be compatible with the three-clause BSD license.

If I change employers I will either terminate my write (push) permission
or submit a new e-mail confirmation with my updated information 
in advance of the transition to my new job.

Sincerely, <insert name>
